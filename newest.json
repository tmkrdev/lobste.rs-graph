you? We have many open [bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues) and I try to label [good first issues](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) to make it easy to get started.\r\n\r\nThe theme in this last year of development has been cleaning up accumulated tech debt, mostly as we've had the opportunity to replace our homegrown features with Rails versions.\r\nLately I've spent more time reviewing contributions than writing code myself, which is a wonderful milestone in the viability of the codebase.\r\n(Probably means fewer bugs yolod into prod, too.)\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned that commenting is at an all-time high and in that same spirit of bringing on contributors, I'd like to invite people to DM or email me (not comment) if they're interested in becoming mods on the site.\r\nThis mostly means tidying story titles or tags, removing business news, and infrequently reminding people to be kind to one another.\r\nPlease tell me about what you'd be interested in helping with, whether you have experience that's relevant to be a mod, and what you'd like to see from the site.\r\nI'll follow up with you individually from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance aside, let's look back at the year's [top stories](https://lobste.rs/top/1y) and review our upvoted [comments](https://lobste.rs/upvoted/comments) and [stories](https://lobste.rs/upvoted/stories) for favorites.\r\n\r\nPreviously:\r\n[2013](https://lobste.rs/s/rxmopc/lobsters_is_1_year_old_today)\r\n[2016](https://lobste.rs/s/9fcuzc/happy_birthday_lobste_rs)\r\n[2017](https://lobste.rs/s/mazaum/happy_5th_anniversary_lobsters)\r\n[2019](https://lobste.rs/s/cgtc2w/happy_7th_anniversary_lobsters)\r\n[2020](https://lobste.rs/s/orrpdv/lobsters_launched_8_years_ago_today)\r\n[2021](https://lobste.rs/s/idj3tm/lobsters_is_nine_today)\r\n[2022](https://lobste.rs/s/jclvos/one_decade_lobsters)\r\n[2023](https://lobste.rs/s/hhoopi/lobsters_is_11_today)\r\n[2024](https://lobste.rs/s/slfdci/one_dozen_lobsters)","submitter_user":"pushcx","user_is_author":true,"tags":["announce"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8we4dn","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8we4dn/lucky_13_lobsters"},{"short_id":"2zw0zw","created_at":"2025-07-03T08:33:30.000-05:00","title":"Autoformalization of mathematical theorems?
