As part of this effort, a deep-dive is performed into the machine-dependent aspects of bootstrap, memory, trap, process, and device subsystems of the OpenBSD kernel. The ported OpenBSD kernel has implemented early bootstrap logic in assembly, adapted PMAP to RISC-V MMU in Sv39-mode, developed trap handlers for interrupts and exceptions, implemented routines for process fork and context switch, and developed drivers to probe and attach machine-dependent devices. With these efforts, the OpenBSD kernel can boot on a QEMU-emulated RISC-V hardware target up through entry into the init process.","submitter_user":"mjturner","user_is_author":false,"tags":["openbsd","pdf"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/koetct","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/koetct/porting_openbsd_risc_v_isa_2020"},{"short_id":"wiu8md","created_at":"2025-07-03T04:05:41.000-05:00","title":"Writing Code Was Never The Bottleneck","url":"https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"eduard","user_is_author":false,"tags":["vibecoding"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wiu8md","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wiu8md/writing_code_was_never_bottleneck"},{"short_id":"ik12td","created_at":"2025-07-03T03:56:33.000-05:00","title":"How to manage configuration settings in Go web applications","url":"https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/how-to-manage-configuration-settings-in-go-web-applications","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"eduard","user_is_author":false,"tags":["go"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ik12td","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ik12td/how_manage_configuration_settings_go_web"},{"short_id":"rpb1g7","created_at":"2025-07-03T03:47:38.000-05:00","title":"RFC 9799: ACME Extensions for \".onion\"","url":"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9799/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"cve","user_is_author":false,"tags":["cryptography","security"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rpb1g7","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rpb1g7/rfc_9799_acme_extensions_for_onion"},{"short_id":"fihakk","created_at":"2025-07-03T03:40:06.000-05:00","title":"Recreating Laravel Cloud’s range input with native HTML","url":"https://phare.io/blog/recreating-laravel-clouds-range-input-with-native-html/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"nicbvs","user_is_author":true,"tags":["a11y","css","design"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fihakk","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fihakk/recreating_laravel_cloud_s_range_input"},{"short_id":"rxdnnq","created_at":"2025-07-03T02:59:55.000-05:00","title":"Introducing the first alpha of Turso: The next evolution of SQLite","url":"https://turso.tech/blog/turso-the-next-evolution-of-sqlite?ref=console.dev","score":29,"flags":0,"comment_count":29,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"antonmedv","user_is_author":false,"tags":["rust"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rxdnnq","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rxdnnq/introducing_first_alpha_turso_next"},{"short_id":"pdl32t","created_at":"2025-07-02T20:40:11.000-05:00","title":"copyleft-next","url":"https://next.copyleft.org/","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"legoktm","user_is_author":false,"tags":["law"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pdl32t","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pdl32t/copyleft_next"},{"short_id":"jwyu1t","created_at":"2025-07-02T18:25:59.000-05:00","title":"Rediscovering the Beauty of Chemistry Through Quantum Theory and Prolog","url":"https://medium.com/@kenichisasagawa/the-beginning-666ff734e647","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"petecorey","user_is_author":false,"tags":["programming","science"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jwyu1t","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jwyu1t/rediscovering_beauty_chemistry_through"},{"short_id":"w4vmvd","created_at":"2025-07-02T18:17:55.000-05:00","title":"The Amiga 3000 UNIX and Sun Microsystems: Deal or no deal?","url":"https://www.datagubbe.se/amix/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"classichasclass","user_is_author":false,"tags":["retrocomputing","unix"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/w4vmvd","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/w4vmvd/amiga_3000_unix_sun_microsystems_deal_no"},{"short_id":"boqpjf","created_at":"2025-07-02T17:39:07.000-05:00","title":"Can we test it?
