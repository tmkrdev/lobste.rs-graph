As a recent Phoronix article explains,\r\nthe Linux Rust subsystem got into major drama because of my humble quest. \r\n\r\nWell, here's my side of the story, with every kernel of truth exposed.\r\n\r\n## A Moral Quest for Pizza\r\n\r\nDespite being an experienced programmer, I found myself  in the familiar\r\nsituation of being down in my luck financially - mostly as a result of taking\r\nextended sabbaticals to recover from burnout.\r\n\r\nI'm not one to handle prolonged contact with the overt authoritarianism of the\r\ntypical HR department.\r\n\r\nMy bank account was approaching a segmentation fault - I wish I'd held meme\r\nstocks a bit longer in 2021. \r\n\r\nSo, I entered my familiar survival mode: Grinding LeetCode, writing job\r\napplications, and cutting luxuries like overpriced sushi delivery.\r\n\r\nOne well-known hack for programmers in such dire straits is, of course, the\r\nfree food circuit of programming meetups. Luck had it that a Rust meetup was\r\nscheduled for the next day, with \"pizza\" explicitly mentioned in the event\r\ntitle. \r\n\r\nThe catch? I had never touched Rust.\r\n\r\nHere's where my conscience started throwing exceptions: I couldn't just\r\nfreeload pizza. I had to earn each slice. I had to know at least some Rust. \r\n\r\nI had to become a Rustacean in just 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOwnership, lifetimes, the borrow checker - all of the Rust Book got crammed\r\ninto my brain through copious amounts of cheap instant coffee and a sleepless\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, I hyped myself up with some push-ups, and a shower to some\r\n80's synthwave, singing out loud Yazoo's \"Don't Go\" (a wise omen in\r\nretrospect).\r\n\r\n## The Meetup\r\n\r\nI stumbled into the co-working space, armed with the ability to nod knowingly\r\nat entry-level Rust concepts.\r\n\r\nThe exposed bricks and Edison bulbs enhanced the feeling of limbo, neither\r\nfully \"work\" nor \"social event.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours in, the scent of pepperoni and Option\u003cPineapple\u003e was filling the\r\nroom as the ASCII progress bar of the last speaker's fancy TUI slides had\r\ntraversed just 25%. My stomach was sending system calls.\r\n\r\nThe presentation ends, and the moment of truth arrives: The food table.\r\n\r\nI devised a plan to maximize intake and abstractly offset my monetary\r\nshortcomings. This military-grade operation involved timed passes around the\r\ntable, making sure to take sizable but stealthy bites, and securing additional\r\nslices for consumption in a secluded area, only to return later for\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe first challenge came when a legitimate Rust developer started discussing\r\nlifetimes with me, one of the hardest Rust topics.\r\n\r\n\"That's right...\" I managed, \"The lifetimes are... almost Husserlian.\"\r\n\r\nHe blinked. \"Husserlian?\"\r\n\r\nDid he see through my bluff? My only choice was to double down:\r\n\r\n\"Yes the, uh, German philosopher… last name Husserl… You know, we experience\r\ntime as conscious beings in a temporal horizon… All is Rust. You know, man?\"\r\nMy sleep-deprived brain attempted some desperate pattern matching.\r\n\r\nHe looked confused, then nodded slowly, perhaps mistaking my panic for\r\nprofundity. Mission accomplished. Another slice was mine.\r\n\r\nI was on my fourth \"first\" slice (plus three more surreptitiously eaten ones)\r\nand ready to leave, when someone mentioned the after-party.\r\n\r\n## The After-Party\r\n\r\nWhat happened next exists in my memory like fragmented data blocks.\r\n\r\nI found myself in deep conversation with a group of Venezuelan femboy Rust\r\ndevelopers who were building something revolutionary in the \"post-capitalist\r\nspace.\" Their programming socks were striped pink, and their confidence in\r\ntheir technology was infectious.\r\n\r\n\"You should buy crypto options,\" one of them suggested. \"I have a hunch about\r\na meme coin. Trust me.\"\r\n\r\nIn my altered state after several Aperol spritzes, this seemed like sound\r\nfinancial advice. I FOMOed my puny savings at the obscure coin with a logo of\r\nthe Rust crab holding a bottle of coconut oil.\r\n\r\nMinutes later, impossibly, the value shot up 400%. Our phones buzzed with\r\nprofit notifications. The only thing to do then was to celebrate by visiting\r\nthat ketamine bar everyone had been whispering about.\r\n\r\n## The Kernel Incident\r\n\r\nIn our transcendent state, over hardcore techno music, we did what any group\r\nof intoxicated \"nouveau riche\" programmers would do: We pair programmed a\r\npatch to the Linux kernel's Rust subsystem.\r\n\r\nIt essentially replaced close to 50% of the code base with Rust, thanks to\r\nsome inspired macro magic and a 100% use of our brainpower. The tests were\r\npassing until we got bored and terminated the process.\r\n\r\nI considered the morality of sending such a huge patch on a whim, but I was\r\noperating under a different set of ethical principles at that point - ethics\r\nof a more cosmic nature.\r\n\r\nWe submitted it at 6:47 AM with a commit message that just read: \"The crab has\r\nawakened. Prima Nocta is imposed on all unsafe languages.\"\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommit deadbeefb9e1d3f5a6c8e2b4d7f9a1c3e5b7d9f2a4c6e8b1d3f5a7c9e2b4d6f8a\r\nAuthor: Sebastian Carlos \u003csebastiancarlos@protonmail.com\u003e\r\nDate:   Tue Jun 03 06:47:23 2025 +666\r\n\r\n    The crab has awakened.

I woke up two days later in my apartment.\r\n\r\n## The Reckoning\r\n\r\nOur Linux patch had not only been rejected but had apparently been the final\r\nstraw for Linus Torvalds, who announced in a profanity-laden email that he was\r\nremoving all Rust code from the kernel.\r\n\r\n\"I've had it,\" his email read. \"At least C developers know when they're\r\ndrunk.\"\r\n\r\nPhoronix was in uproar about the \"Ketamine Kernel Incident.\" My GitHub profile\r\nhad become a cautionary tale.\r\n\r\nAfter soberly checking my earnings, I realized my $100 investment resulted in\r\na profit of just $400 before fees and taxes. Not enough to quit my job hunt.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, the whole experience reminded me of my last job: Good\r\nintentions, moral compromises, and spectacular burnout.\r\n\r\nBut the real shock came when I opened my wardrobe that evening, looking for\r\nclean clothes to wear to my job interview in a couple of hours. \r\n\r\nThere was a collection of striped pink programmer socks. Dozens of them, like\r\nsome sort of Rust swag. Where had they come from?\r\n\r\nBut hey, at least I got pizza, and the socks were surprisingly comfortable.","submitter_user":"sebastiancarlos","user_is_author":true,"tags":["satire"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mrbuca","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mrbuca/i_learned_rust_24_hours_eat_free_pizza"},{"short_id":"3bgtx3","created_at":"2025-06-05T23:22:28.000-05:00","title":"Convolutions, Polynomials and Flipped Kernels","url":"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/convolutions-polynomials-and-flipped-kernels/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","submitter_user":"azhenley","user_is_author":false,"tags":["math"],"short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3bgtx3","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3bgtx3/convolutions_polynomials_flipped"}]
