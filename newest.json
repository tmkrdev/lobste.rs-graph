Designing the storage layer with S3 as shared storage has become the new “silver bullet” for data-intensive software today. However, using S3 alone does not address latency issues. Our storage layer design utilizes a small size EBS as a high-speed WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) cache for writing, with data in memory asynchronously flushed to S3. This approach not only leverages the cost and elasticity benefits of shared storage but also ensures low latency.
