We integrated Robust Predicate Transfer with DuckDB, a state-of-the-art analytical database, and evaluated against all the queries in TPC-H, JOB, and TPC-DS benchmarks. Our experimental results show that RPT improves join-order robustness by orders of magnitude compared to the baseline. With RPT, the largest ratio between the maximum and minimum execution time out of random join orders for a single acyclic query is only 1.6x (the ratio is close to 1 for most evaluated queries). Meanwhile, applying RPT also improves the end-to-end query performance by 1.5x (per-query geometric mean).
