We analyze the correlations between cosmic rays and DRAM errors on two HPC clusters: a production supercomputer with server-class DDR3-1600 and a prototype with LPDDR3-1600 and no hardware error correction. Our error logs cover 2000 billion MB-hours for the MareNostrum 3 supercomputer and 135 million MB-hours for the Mont-Blanc prototype.
