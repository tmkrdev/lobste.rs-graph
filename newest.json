We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil (memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and Hartree–Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We show that Mojo’s performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memorybound kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
