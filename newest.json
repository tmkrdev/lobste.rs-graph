My conversations with the Commodore 64 happened much too early, starting with the Usborne Publishing ‘Computer Battlegames’ book and continued into devouring anything the local library could provide thereafter, picking up English in the process. This took place in a small village close to the 56th parallel north where computers were mostly dismissed as witchcraft and being accused of performing witchcraft didn’t make life any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will try and fail to keep this short, condensing the last three decades into three pivotal moments. The first moment from my preteens-into-teens was emulation. With home consoles becoming more prevalent I got curious as to why games on one system wouldn’t run on another, especially not on my own beloved computer: Isn’t it all just code? I started asking around in the circle of much older explorers and penpals and got a cursory explanation that it was difficult and unreasonable. That sounded like just my thing. Someone handed me a printout of phone numbers to ‘Bulletin Boards’ which led to heavier drugs like FidoNet and a small world suddenly became very large and down the rabbit hole I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second pivot was the PhD thing. I enrolled at university to try and get some structure to the chaos of being primarily autodidactic. It was a small university that had the reputation of being a place for ‘hackers’ through the ‘software engineering’ disguise. For a small pocket of time the student housing area was a sight to behold, and every scene from cracking to osdev to demos to gamedev was represented in abundance. There was an offer of a place to work in a lab, coding 3D engines and visualizations for demonstrators of autonomous coordination of naval vessels and submarines and things like that. I built something of a repertoire with the professor that was pulling the strings, which started the doctoral journey. My main interest was (and remains) debugging when things grow large, complex and distributed. Following the money meant that the best fit at the time was SCADA for critical infrastructure, and the consequences when energy systems would need to be restructured to deal with consumers also being producers and you can no longer hide behind the lie of control systems being ‘air-gapped’. In that context nobody would listen if you talked debugging, so I had to flip the switch to talk about security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third pivot was first an industrial collaboration that turned into employment at a tiger-team (the ‘Men in Black’) at Sony-Ericsson, now SONY Mobile. This happened just before the transition from feature-phones into smartphones. This group dealt with putting out fires, meaning critical bugs that others had given up on but meant the death of a product or possibly the company if it caused device returns. The margins were razor thin; if you could save a few cents on the BOM by not having a MMU and process isolation, you saved a few cents on the BOM. A close friend and I tried to distil some of these lessons into trainings and a university course on the subject, with the ‘NDA friendly’ version still around on the Internet somewhere under the idea of ‘Systemic Software Debugging’ which I hope to revisit someday in a more approachable format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your work/computing environment like?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery compartmentalised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house is less of a house and more of a daycare for forever young techies. I have one lab for coding with a big desktop and a lot of ‘one purpose devices’, novelty displays and input tech. Of note is a small cluster of ephemeral devices that boot from preset images and run some software that I need but deeply distrust (like web browsers). These reset and re-image (saving raw-disk diffs if something strange happens) and map into tabs, though the windowing scheme used is quite different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work offline with ‘bare minimal’ editor and man pages instead of IDEs and autocompletion as I tend to, paraphrasing James Mickens, break my tools with my tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lab doubles as a home theater. This is used for VR and general controlled environment ‘audio/video’ testing. The more playful things happen in the basement area around pinball machines and DIY arcade games. Pinballs are great fun for computer-vision like experiments. The latest addition is a more controlled space for lower level hardware work - with the usual scopes, some laser ‘cutters’, CNCs, 3D printers and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also rely on printing things on paper and scribble. I always carry at least one notebook or e-Ink notetaker. There is also something almost purifying when later shredding and incinerating the evidence. When travelling, commuting or just hiding in a pub or bar for a change of scenery I nowadays tend to use AR glasses hooked up to a steam deck or laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt some point it appears that you decided to rewrite the *NIX graphics stack from scratch, how did that happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly and regrettably. Knowing what I know today I probably would not have bothered. I approach ‘system graphics’ from an angle of signal processing and queueing theory (IPC systems) rather than what most think of as ‘graphics’. In that sense we are mixing and resampling signals much more than drawing pixels. Very little of the actual work is modern graphics, and I am artificially constrained by the capability ‘sweet-spot’ of the first generation Raspberry Pi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is done in order to get away from the influence of GPUs that only a few can build and comprehend, and to be able to work on simpler dedicated processors that many more can design and build. Many architectural decisions in Arcan are explicitly to begin the painful decoupling from proprietary GPUs. The modern GPU ecosystem is highly abusive and deliberately user unfriendly yet is in a place where it is actually running the show. I don’t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a personal story of trying to build the panopticon of debugging. With that I mean ‘observing and experimenting’ with the Rube Goldberg contraption of what we unknowingly build by smashing pieces of software together. Even though the individual pieces can sometimes be formally proven to work and then actually made to work, the solutions that we end up with often solves some problem in a very convoluted way, but we lack the faculties to see it. Part of the reason for that is a tooling problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis coincides with the other side of the same coin. What I am trying to achieve with the Arcan project, and the sole reason any of this is public, is that I want to string together some of the frayed threads of our history. With that I mean to resurrect some of what we lost from the personal computer era where you just ‘powered on and started to code’ as a means of exploring computing. This is not meant as a retrocomputing romance. The output should be more capable than what we already have, not less. There are other and far more interesting and intimate webs to uncover than the ones we have, Ted Nelson even said as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also why I keep aiming that any layer follows the model of having agency be defined and scriptable in Lua - which I find to be a more civilized take on BASIC.

For a long time I simply used Xorg as the user space portion of the display driver and had all my bits and pieces running as the one and only full screen surface, just disable its native socket after setup and done.

If so, ancillary systems chime in and compensate for abandoned opportunity. That is how you get “advertisement and 3rd party cookies”, man-in-the-middle “shorteners” and so on. Just as the dynamics would change if the one being linked contractually knows who linked to them, the rules we bake in here has a profound systemic effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could make all OS kernels include one feature, and have compatible implementations supported everywhere, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the pragmatic reality of dealing with- and sustaining- legacy while also paving the way for new things is the most important part for the kernel to play and curate, so this is really for the popular user facing kernels and not more research, nostalgia or server specialized ones. The biggest problem I have right now is not the lack of any singular feature, but how the current ones are exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single most expensive and needlessly painful parts have been working with capabilities and resource identifier tokens, whatever we call them (HANDLEs, file descriptors). The POSIX ones are worst in class, much thanks to the sparse allocation requirement but also thanks to the staggered evolution of all the support functions that comes with it. This is worse in graphics where you might need to juggle tens of tokens to cover even a single image frame. Connected to this is process and thread creation but that is only part of the story.

Having one interface for FPGAs, a handful for GPUs, others for tracing then to try and specify the compute, lifecycle, resource access permissions, data transfer and error handling conditions over things as unrefined and inefficient as kill, mmap, mprotect, madvise, read, write, exec etc. is soul-crushing to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI found a lot of the low level bits of the open source graphics stacks very hard to understand, what would you recommend for someone wanting to get started in this area?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA challenge in unpacking the graphic stack is that it is not in a single discrete place, but smeared all over. Surprisingly little is actually ‘inside’ the display server API or display server itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch more live in the accelerated graphics API, and how it talks to kernel devices (this is MESA and through it, KMS/GBM or HWC/Gralloc in Android). That said, MESA has many faces and while the public ones relate to the many versions and extensions of GL and Vulkan, that is only part of the story. For the actual ‘graphics’ part, that is the place to study or use as reference. Note that the MESA codebase started around 1993 with all that entails. It’s not an easy read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I think is the best course of action depends a bit on where you current intuition took a wrong turn. The most common one in my experience is the mistake of thinking of a ‘framebuffer’ that you batch write ‘pixels’ into, binned by some discrete synchronization signal (‘vsynch’, ‘vblank’, …). This is common because that is often at least part of what higher level graphics API used to offer the developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe printer was, and is, a more accurate model. Just as there was good reason for why the printer server part of Xorg fell out of favour, there was good reason for why it was there in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe still queue deeply paginated batches of draw commands to a strange and foreign device that looks at colours very differently from what we do; papers still get stuck; often we want to cancel a dispatched job because it contained the wrong thing or something changed; render times vary wildly for unclear reasons and so on. The display server do to render jobs what the printer spooler did to print jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the real system graphics experience however, pick a single usecase in normal desktop use that is common. The one that I prefer when comparing is ‘drag resizing’ a window as it really gives every subsystem a good shake. This is where you will find the biggest divergence between solutions and near every design decision comes into scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"After @PhantomZorba did the [interview with me last month](https://lobste.rs/s/ttr8op/lobsters_interview_with_david_chisnall) we decided to try to make the lobste.rs interview series a relay, where each interviewee then interviews someone else.

For the last few years I have been an independent contractor working with smaller startups in information security. I have just finished a longer engagement into hardware reversing and am taking something of a breather doing more playful things. On the open-source side of the world, I am the architect and lead engineer of the Arcan project.\r\n\r\nThere are paper trails that say I am a software engineer, yet others that say I am a computer scientist.

The most common one in my experience is the mistake of thinking of a ‘framebuffer’ that you batch write ‘pixels’ into, binned by some discrete synchronization signal (‘vsynch’, ‘vblank’, …). This is common because that is often at least part of what higher level graphics API used to offer the developer.\r\n\r\nThe printer was, and is, a more accurate model. Just as there was good reason for why the printer server part of Xorg fell out of favour, there was good reason for why it was there in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe still queue deeply paginated batches of draw commands to a strange and foreign device that looks at colours very differently from what we do; papers still get stuck; often we want to cancel a dispatched job because it contained the wrong thing or something changed; render times vary wildly for unclear reasons and so on. The display server do to render jobs what the printer spooler did to print jobs.\r\n\r\nFor the real system graphics experience however, pick a single usecase in normal desktop use that is common. The one that I prefer when comparing is ‘drag resizing’ a window as it really gives every subsystem a good shake. This is where you will find the biggest divergence between solutions and near every design decision comes into scrutiny.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/w3zkxx/lobsters_interview_with_bjorn_stahl","submitter_user":{"username":"david_chisnall","created_at":"2020-03-19T12:44:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I am Director of System Architecture at SCI Semiconductor and a Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.
