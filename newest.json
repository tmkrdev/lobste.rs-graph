Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks, from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about $100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn’s lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn’s Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems).\nThe approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library.
