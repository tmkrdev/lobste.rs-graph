We present GPUlog, a Datalog engine backend that implements iterated relational algebra kernels over a novel range-indexed data structure we call the hash-indexed sorted array (HISA). HISA combines the algorithmic benefits of incremental range-indexed relations with the raw computation throughput of operations over dense data structures.
