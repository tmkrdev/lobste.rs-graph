Safe C++","url":"","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":25,"description":"\u003cp\u003eBy now you should have heard that various government agencies are\nissuing clear recommendations against using languages that aren’t\nmemory safe by default. This led many to wonder what the future viability\nof C++ was. I’m an avid C++ programmer but when faced with the reality\nof how software is built, I have to applaud the effort here. Sure,\nmaybe I trust myself to write correct programs but truthfully I simply\nwould feel at least an order of magnitude safer if I knew the\nengineers building critical infrastructure like CT scan machines,\ncommercial airline flight systems, or missile guidance systems were\nforced to use a memory safe language. I think that most reasonable\npeople would admit the same, regretfully or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway I got to wondering if it was possible to write C++ that was\nsafe by default. I know that people on the Chromium team \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vSt2VB1zQAJ6JDMaIA9PlmEgBxz2K5Tx6w2JqJNeYCy0gU4aoubdTxlENSKNSrQ2TXqPWcuwtXe6PlO/pub?pli=1\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003einvestigated\nmodeling the Rust borrow checker using the C++ type\nsystem\u003c/a\u003e\nunsuccessfully. There have also been reports written by C++ committee\nmembers about a “safe subset” of the language which feels like complex\nvaporware. It generally seems like the consensus among everyone is\nthat there is no viable or practical path forward to memory safety in\nC++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I thought about it a bit more and came up with a simple (though\nperhaps inefficient) approach to having memory safety in C++ in a way\nthat you can deploy in your projects today, with varying degrees of\ndifficulty. The idea is to provide two additional smart pointer types\nthat mimic \u003ccode\u003eunique_ptr\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eshared_ptr\u003c/code\u003e but explicitly check bounds\non pointer dereference. Additionally they annotate the pointer\ndereference operators with \u003ccode\u003e[[clang::lifetimebound]]\u003c/code\u003e. The combination\nof these two features make it impossible to trigger a use-after-free\nor buffer overflow error at runtime.

This led many to wonder what the future viability\r\nof C++ was. I'm an avid C++ programmer but when faced with the reality\r\nof how software is built, I have to applaud the effort here. Sure,\r\nmaybe I trust myself to write correct programs but truthfully I simply\r\nwould feel at least an order of magnitude safer if I knew the\r\nengineers building critical infrastructure like CT scan machines,\r\ncommercial airline flight systems, or missile guidance systems were\r\nforced to use a memory safe language. I think that most reasonable\r\npeople would admit the same, regretfully or not.\r\n\r\nAnyway I got to wondering if it was possible to write C++ that was\r\nsafe by default. I know that people on the Chromium team [investigated\r\nmodeling the Rust borrow checker using the C++ type\r\nsystem](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vSt2VB1zQAJ6JDMaIA9PlmEgBxz2K5Tx6w2JqJNeYCy0gU4aoubdTxlENSKNSrQ2TXqPWcuwtXe6PlO/pub?pli=1)\r\nunsuccessfully. There have also been reports written by C++ committee\r\nmembers about a \"safe subset\" of the language which feels like complex\r\nvaporware. It generally seems like the consensus among everyone is\r\nthat there is no viable or practical path forward to memory safety in\r\nC++.\r\n\r\nSo I thought about it a bit more and came up with a simple (though\r\nperhaps inefficient) approach to having memory safety in C++ in a way\r\nthat you can deploy in your projects today, with varying degrees of\r\ndifficulty. The idea is to provide two additional smart pointer types\r\nthat mimic `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` but explicitly check bounds\r\non pointer dereference. Additionally they annotate the pointer\r\ndereference operators with `[[clang::lifetimebound]]`. The combination\r\nof these two features make it impossible to trigger a use-after-free\r\nor buffer overflow error at runtime.
