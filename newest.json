A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark.
